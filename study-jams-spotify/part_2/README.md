## Getting Spotify Developer Account Information
Navigate back to your Spotify Developer Account that you created in the last workshop. Be sure to take note of the following information:
- Client ID

## Creating the Login / Artist Page
### Revisiting Templates
Remember a template in Meteor is just the basic structure the application will follow whenever a certain name is referenced.

To refresh your memory on what templates are we are going to work on creating two templates. We have already created the basic application layout in our last workshop. Now let's create a button at the home screen of our application. This is what users will use to login and use our app.

Let's navigate to the following path: `client/templates/login.html`
Open up the login.html file in your favorite text editor.

Here's where the fun happens!
